# Flappy Bug
**This Flappy Bug game is done as part of the CS-A1110 Ohjelmointi 1 (Programming 1) course at Aalto University.**
- The user plays the game by repeatedly pressing the space button to control the bug and prevent it from colliding with the approaching obstacles.
- The game ends when either the bug falls into the ground/ moves too high or the bug collides with the obstacle.  
- The user could modify the game appearance based on his/her own favor (for instance: change the obstacle/ bug) by placing the image inside the directory and link the code into the image file, change the speed of the approaching obstacle/ the bug or change the key press used to move the bug. 

**The project is programmed in Scala language.**
